# Rapid Reader
**The new way to read**

#### Motivation

I'm a fast reader--very fast. When reading though, I find that it takes me more time to turn back to the start of the line than it took me to read the line. To combat this, I started reading line-by-line, but I asked myself,

> What if you could read, but not move your eyes?

This would eliminate the need to scan for letters and instead, you could take in a single word at a time and as fast as you want.

So I threw this app together and I use it to train myself and to cram before a book review.

#### Usage

Open up [RapidReader](https://jairussw.github.io/rapidreader.github.io/), paste the text you want to read, and click start.
You can press space to start and stop.

You can find a section of Dante's Inferno to read [HERE](https://github.com/JairusSW/RapidReader/raw/master/assets/books/dante-inferno/1.txt)

TIP: Try using the line-by-line mode if you can't comprehend it!
